\# Beyond The Tracks: Evaluating Transport-led Regeneration Impact on Businessesâ€™ Dynamics, Sectoral Shifts, and Agglomeration, The Case of Northern Line Extension.



Project description and Abstract:

In recent decades, strategic transport investment has been increasingly employed to support regeneration initiatives and stimulate economic activity. Yet, their impact on businesses' dynamics, sectoral shifts, and agglomeration remains unexplored, particularly in London context. As these projects are usually justified based on their economic impact, assessing their outcome is essential to better inform policymakers. This research investigated the impact of the Northern Line Extension on business dynamics, sectoral composition, and agglomeration in Vauxhall, Nine Elms, and Battersea Opportunity Area. Drawing on unique firm-level datasets, including the Business Census and Business Rates, and applying methods like Adjusted Interrupted Time Series and Spatial Clustering (HDBSCAN), this analysis evaluates businesses' dynamics, agglomeration patterns, and sectoral shifts, focusing on two points in time (construction starting year and opening year) while considering trends following those points. The findings suggest a redistribution of economic activity rather than net growth, with retail sectors benefiting the most. The anticipation effect mainly drove this pattern. At the same time, the findings indicate increased agglomeration of businesses around the stations, specifically in the form of urbanisation economies, reflecting a diverse mix of industries. The study contributes to understanding the impact of transport-led regeneration by providing one of the first evaluations of this impact in London and offers insights into future urban policy.
